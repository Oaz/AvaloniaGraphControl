# AvaloniaGraphControl
A graph layout panel for [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)

## Usage
Each individual graph is displayed through the GraphPanel control included in the assembly
```xml
<Window xmlns:agc="clr-namespace:AvaloniaGraphControl;assembly=AvaloniaGraphControl">
    <agc:GraphPanel Graph="{Binding MyGraph}" LayoutMethod="SugiyamaScheme" />
</Window>
```

The layout is internally implemented with [MSAGL (Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout)](https://github.com/microsoft/automatic-graph-layout).

The following layout methods are available in MSAGL and can be set in the GraphPanel control independently of the graph model:
* [SugiyamaScheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_graph_drawing)
* [MDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_majorization)
* Ranking
* IncrementalLayout

### MVVM

The GraphPanel control leverages the [MVVM pattern used by AvaloniaUI](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/concepts/the-mvvm-pattern/).
Each node of the graph view can be customized according to the underlying view model in the graph definition.

```xml
<Window xmlns:agc="clr-namespace:AvaloniaGraphControl;assembly=AvaloniaGraphControl">
    <agc:GraphPanel Graph="{Binding MyGraph}" LayoutMethod="SugiyamaScheme" />
      <agc:GraphPanel.DataTemplates>
        <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type local:StandardItem}">
          <agc:TextSticker Text="{Binding Name}" Shape="Ellipse" Padding="30,10" />
        </DataTemplate>
        <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type local:InteractiveItem}">
          <ToggleButton Content="{Binding Name}" Padding="20,5" />
        </DataTemplate>
      </agc:GraphPanel.DataTemplates>
    </agc:GraphPanel>
</Window>
```

### Cross-platform

As shown in the demo, this graph panel can be used in cross-platform AvaloniaUI applications.
It was successfully tested on Linux Desktop, Windows Desktop, Android and Browser (web assembly) environments.

## Example of graph definition

```C#
public static Graph MyGraph
{
  get
  {
    var graph = new Graph();
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("A", "B"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("A", "D"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("A", "E"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("B", "C"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("B", "D"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("D", "A"));
    graph.Edges.Add(new Edge("D", "E"));
    return graph;
  }
}
```
